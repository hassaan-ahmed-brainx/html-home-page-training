        <u> Adobe Photoshop </u>

      is a raster graphics editor developed and published by Adobe Systems for
      macOS and Windows. Photoshop was created in 1988 by Thomas and John Knoll.
      Since then, it has become the de facto industry standard in raster
      graphics editing, such that the word "photoshop" has become a verb as in
      "to Photoshop an image," "photoshopping" and "photoshop contest", though
      Adobe discourages such use.
